          His scientific works included helping with the development of a small sundial which was part of the missions of the Mars Exploration Rover. It was called the MarsDial and it had small panels of different colors. It was used for calibrating colors and as a timekeeping device. In 2005, Bill became The Planetary Society’s vice president, and this society advocated space research especially on other planets—Mars in particular. In 2006, Bill was a supporter of Pluto’s reclassification from being a planet to a dwarf planet.
